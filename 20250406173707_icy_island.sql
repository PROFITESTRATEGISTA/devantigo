  # Prevent deleting all versions

  1. Changes
    - Add check to prevent deleting Version 1 if it's the only version
    - Add check to prevent deleting the last version
    - Update delete_robot_version function with better validation
    - Add trigger to prevent direct deletion of versions

  2. Security
    - All functions run with SECURITY DEFINER
    - Proper permission checks in place
